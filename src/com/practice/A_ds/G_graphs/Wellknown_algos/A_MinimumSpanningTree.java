 * A spanning tree is a connected subgraph in an undirected graph where
 * all vertices are connected with the minimum number of edges
 *
 * A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight in a “weighted undirected graph”
 *
 * we will learn about the “cut property and two algorithms for constructing a “minimum spanning tree”:
 * 1. Kruskal’s Algorithm
 * 2. Prim’s algorithm

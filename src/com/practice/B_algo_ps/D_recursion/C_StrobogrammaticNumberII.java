    /**
     * Explanation of above solution::
     *
     * If the length of the number is 1:
     * The digit will remain at the same position and rotate 180Â°.
     * Thus, the numbers can only be 0, 1, and 8.
     *
     *
     * If the length is 2:
     * We have two positions (say indices 0 and 1), which will interchange.
     *
     * So we can use,
     * Either two same digits which remain the same after rotation, 11 and 88.
     * Take note that we can't use 0 here because 00 is not a 2 digit number. So we can't place 0 at the 0th
     * index of any number, except for the number 0 itself.
     *
     * Or, two digits that change into one another, 69 and 96.
     * Thus, 2-digit strobogrammatic numbers will be, 11, 69, 88, and 96.
     *
     *
     * If the length is 3:
     * We have three positions (say indices 0, 1, and 2) and out of these three positions, index 0 and index 2 will interchange, but index 1 will remain in the same place.
     *
     * Suppose we have all of the 1-digit strobogrammatic numbers. To find the 3-digit strobogrammatic numbers,
     * we just need to append one extra digit at the beginning and at the end which are reversible.
     * Here, reversible means it will keep the number strobogrammatic.
     * We know that we can use both types of digits (those that change into each other or remain the same after rotation)
     * for this position. But keep in mind that we can't append 0 at the beginning.
     *
     * => '0' + (1-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '0'
     * '0' + '0' + '0' = '000'  (1-digit number) (not valid)
     * '0' + '1' + '0' = '010' (2-digit number) (not valid)
     * '0' + '8' + '0' = '080' (2-digit number) (not valid)
     *
     * => '1' + (1-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '1'
     * '1' + '0' + '1' = '101'
     * '1' + '1' + '1' = '111'
     * '1' + '8' + '1' = '181'
     *
     * => '6' + (1-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '9'
     * '6' + '0' + '9' = '609'
     * '6' + '1' + '9' = '619'
     * '6' + '8' + '9' = '689'
     *
     * => '8' + (1-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '8'
     * '8' + '0' + '8' = '808'
     * '8' + '1' + '8' = '818'
     * '8' + '8' + '8' = '888'
     *
     * => '9' + (1-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '6'
     * '9' + '0' + '6' = '906'
     * '9' + '1' + '6' = '916'
     * '9' + '8' + '6' = '986'
     * Thus, these are all of the 3-digit strobogrammatic numbers: 101, 111, 181, 609, 619, 689, 808, 818, 888, 906, 916, and 986.
     *
     *
     * If the length is 44:
     * We have four positions (say indices 0, 1, 2, and 3), and out of these four positions, (index 0, index 3) and (index 1, index 2) will interchange.
     * Suppose we have all of the 2-digit strobogrammatic numbers. To find the 4-digit strobogrammatic numbers, we just need to append one extra digit at the beginning and the end which are reversible (just like previously discussed).
     * But here, in 2-digit strobogrammatic numbers, we can include 00 because after appending a nonzero digit to the beginning and the end, '00' becomes a valid 4-digit number.
     *
     * => '1' + (2-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '1'
     * '1' + '00' + '1' = '1001'
     * '1' + '11' + '1' = '1111'
     * '1' + '69' + '1' = '1691'
     * '1' + '88' + '1' = '1881'
     * '1' + '96' + '1' = '1961'
     *
     * => '6' + (2-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '9'
     * '6' + '00' + '9' = '6009'
     * '6' + '11' + '9' = '6119'
     * '6' + '69' + '9' = '6699'
     * '6' + '88' + '9' = '6889'
     * '6' + '96' + '9' = '6969'
     *
     * => '8' + (2-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '8'
     * '8' + '00' + '8' = '8008'
     * '8' + '11' + '8' = '8118'
     * '8' + '69' + '8' = '8698'
     * '8' + '88' + '8' = '8888'
     * '8' + '96' + '8' = '8968'
     *
     * => '9' + (2-digit strobogrammatic numbers) + '6'
     * '9' + '00' + '6' = '9006'
     * '9' + '11' + '6' = '9116'
     * '9' + '69' + '6' = '9696'
     * '9' + '88' + '6' = '9886'
     * '9' + '96' + '6' = '9966'
     * Thus, 4-digit strobogrammatic numbers will be 1001, 1111, 1691, 1881, 1961, 6009, 6119, 6699, 6889, 6969, 8008, 8118, 8698, 8888, 8968, 9006, 9116, 9696, 9886, and 9966.

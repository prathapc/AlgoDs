1.
no of subarrays in array:
[1,2,3,4,5] => no of sub arrays are 1+2+3..n => n(n+1)/2 => 15

2.
sub arrays with max bounded:
just keep iterating and incrementing counter if num is less than given max

3.
most of the problems on array are solved with two pointer approach => keep expanding right pointer
as far as given conditions are met, otherwise stop and increment left pointer for optmization

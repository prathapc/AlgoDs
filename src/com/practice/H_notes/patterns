Problem solving patterns:-
------------------------
Arrays:
~~~~~~~
- see if given array is sorted or not. If not sorted, check if sorting makes it easy to arrive at solution
- slow and fast pointers to iterate
- two pointer with hashmap (sometimes removing from map as well required)


Strings:
~~~~~~~~
- two pointer with hashmap
    1. anagram substrings

Recursion:
~~~~~~~~~~

DP:

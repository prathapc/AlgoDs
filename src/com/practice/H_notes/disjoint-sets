Person 1 and Person 2 have the same blood type. Person 2 and Person 4 have the same blood type, and so on.
TO solve this problem, we can construct a graph and answer all queries but complexity will be O(m*n)
considering m persons and n queries.

To solve this efficiently we can use disjoint sets.

"a disjoint set is a data structure where similar elements are kept in a single group"

Two main operations DSU performs on sets are:
Union (X, Y): merges two specified sets into one combined set.
Find (X): It finds the representative (or leader) of the set that contains the element X

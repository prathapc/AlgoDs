 * In Activity Selection Problem, weâ€™re given a set of activities and the starting & finishing time of each activity,
 * we need to find the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person assuming that
 * a person can only work on a single activity at a time.
 *
 * i/p:-
 * (1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (3, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (2, 13), (12, 14)
 * o/p:-
 * (1 4), (5 7), (8 11), (12 14)

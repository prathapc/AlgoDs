Dynamic Programming
-------------------
- most of recursion & knapsack can be optimised with DP

Two ways to solve:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- top-down -> add hashmap for memorization in recursive solution
- bottom-up -> by building dp array (1D/2D)

Which is better?
Any DP algorithm can be implemented with either method, and there are reasons for choosing either over the other. However, each method has one main advantage that stands out:

A bottom-up implementation's runtime is usually faster, as iteration does not have the overhead that recursion does.
A top-down implementation is usually much easier to write. This is because with recursion, the ordering of subproblems does not matter, whereas with tabulation, we need to go through a logical ordering of solving subproblems.

When to Use DP?
- The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times
- The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem

For example (very common for DP problems):

What is the minimum cost of doing...
What is the maximum profit from...
How many ways are there to do...
What is the longest possible...
Is it possible to reach a certain point...

To summarize: if a problem is asking for the maximum/minimum/longest/shortest of something,
the number of ways to do something, or if it is possible to reach a certain point, it is probably greedy or DP.
With time and practice, it will become easier to identify which is the better approach for a given problem.
Although, in general, if the problem has constraints that cause decisions to affect other decisions,
such as using one element prevents the usage of other elements, then we should consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.
These two characteristics can be used to identify if a problem should be solved with DP.

4. DP on Strings
-----------------
Problem List: https://leetcode.com/list/55afh7m7

General problem statement for this pattern can vary but most of the time you are given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big

Statement
Given two strings s1 and s2, return some result.

Approach
Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity.

// i - indexing string s1
// j - indexing string s2
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
       if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       }
   }
}
If you are given one string s the approach may little vary

for (int l = 1; l < n; ++l) {
   for (int i = 0; i < n-l; ++i) {
       int j = i + l;
       if (s[i] == s[j]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {

-------------------
Problem List: https://leetcode.com/list/55af7bu7

The general problem statement for this pattern is forgiven situation decide whether to use or not to use the current state. So, the problem requires you to make a decision at a current state.

Statement
Given a set of values find an answer with an option to choose or ignore the current value.

Approach
If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current value use previous result where value was used.

// i - indexing a set of values
// j - options to ignore j values
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
       dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1]});
       dp[i][j-1] = max({dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], arr[i]});
